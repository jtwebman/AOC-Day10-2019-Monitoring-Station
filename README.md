# Advent of Code - Day 10 - 2019: Monitoring Station

This is my [Advent of Code day 10 solution](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10).

Code here: [/lib/](/lib/)

Tests here: [/test/](/test/)

It is very messy but this took be a longer when I only have an hour her and there.

Would love any feedback!

## Tests

The tests are more integration tests then unit tests and they can be ran:

```
mix test
```
